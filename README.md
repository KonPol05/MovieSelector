# MovieSelector
How many times did you have friends over to watcha movie but you didn't know what to pick? Now you don't have to fight over what movie you are going to choose as this application chooses for you.
You just have to have some movies on your computer and add them to the program. Afterwards just click on "PLAY RANDOM MOVIE" and after some more clicks a randomly picked movie will start playing 
on the media player you have selected as default for that type of file.
